Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.\n']
